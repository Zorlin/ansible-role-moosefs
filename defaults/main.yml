# Installation method to use. Currently only building from source is available.
# In the future, package-based installation will also be available.
# This role will pick the best default option suitable for your OS and hardware automatically.
# But you can also override which method to use - per host if you want!
# If you set this to something other than build (like package) for a host, you can use existing
# Moose machines using package-based installation and otherwise get all the full benefits.
# BETA.

# Special settings for building from source
# After building MooseFS, automatically install it without intervention.
